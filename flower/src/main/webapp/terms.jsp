                    <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Flower Shop's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modify or copy the materials;</li>
                        <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                        <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Flower Shop's website;</li>
                        <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; </li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Flower Shop at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>
