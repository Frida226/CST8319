How to initial an admin because I need use this admin to login "admin dashboard" page?
Until clicking the "Add New Admin" tab, could you enter the admin registration page to create a new admin.
Currently I have some issue that the new created Admin cannot login with his username and password need to figure out later.

To handle all the whole process as an admin role, such as Manage Inventory, Process orders, , please use below method to initially create an admin!

1. populate data to the users as an admin in database(MySQL). EXAMPLE:
INSERT INTO users (username, password_hash, email, role) VALUES
('testAdmin', '1234', 'testAdmin@gmail.com', 'admin');
PS: Here you only use plain password

2.create below PasswordHashingExample.java class (under, such a security package) and run it
import org.mindrot.jbcrypt.BCrypt;

public class PasswordHashingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String plainPassword = "1234";  
        String hashedPassword = BCrypt.hashpw(plainPassword, BCrypt.gensalt());  
        System.out.println("Hashed Password: " + hashedPassword);
    }
}

3. get the Hashed Password from console:
My output is:
Hashed Password: $2a$10$FiD/a2gnRys088lGAdobjO8hdhkbBG8cdbd.JyM7eprOMVmgviE1m

4. update the admin data in MySQL with:
SET password _hash = '$2a$10$FiD/a2gnRys088lGAdobjO8hdhkbBG8cdbd.JyM7eprOMVmgviE1m' WHERE username = 'testAdmin' AND role = 'Admin';

5. on the login page, input with "testAdmin" and "1234", then you can login admin dashboard successfully!
